# ST2205 Tool

This is a mirror of Jeroen Domburg et. al's ST2205 Tool, used to hack the
firmware of a bunch of ST2205-based LCD keychains with custom firmware,
allowing a user to send pixels to it directly. It has been largely abandoned,
so it mostly here for posterity, but I will probably push various small
improvements and bug fixes, which I've used to get it to work on a modern
machine.

The original blog post can be found
[here](https://spritesmods.com/?art=picframe), and most versions of the
firmware can be found [here](https://spritesmods.com/picframe/), though I've
tagged each version in this repo.
