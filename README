Short readme:

- Use make to compile the binaries. You'll probably need the development
  headers and libraries of libgd for this, preferably v2.
- Install libraries: run 'make install' as root
- connect your device and observe (e.g. by running dmesg) the device node
  it's connected to. Look for e.g.:
  SCSI device sda: 4096 512-byte hdwr sectors (2 MB)
  Replace the 'sdX' in the next instruction with the devicename mentioned.
  (in this example: sda)
- If your device already is hacked with an earlier version of the firmware,
  use the backup of the original firmware as an argument to the fwhack.sh 
  script: run './hackfw /dev/sdx /path/to/backup/of/original/fwimage.bak' If
  your device is unhacked as of yet, just run './hackfw /dev/sdX'.
- Run the hackfw.sh program to patch the firmware. It'll backup your firmware
  and do a check on it to see it's patchable. If that's the case and you agree,
  it'll patch it and upload the new firmware.
- If it works, you should be looking at 'It Works' displayed on your LCD.
 
A patched unit still has the same capabilities as an unpatched one. The only
difference is that, in upgrade mode, you can send pictures to the LCD via
the USB-port, which enables stuff like the displaying of real-time server 
statistics.

This patch will work on devices with the ST220XU-chip (which is detected by the
hackfw.sh-program) and have a PCF8833-compatible display. If your device has
a 1.4" or 1.5" color CSTN-screen with a resolution of 128x128 pixels, it'll 
probably work.

FAQ:

Q: I have installed everything by doing a 'make install' as root, but programs
   still can't find libst2205.so.1! What am I doing wrong?
A: Libst2205.so is installed into /usr/local/lib. Make sure your /etc/ld.so.conf
   contains the line '/usr/local/lib' and then run (as root) ldconfig.
