Short readme:

- Use make to compile the binaries. You'll probably need the development
  headers and libraries of libgd for this, preferably v2.
- connect your device and observe (e.g. by running dmesg) the device node
  it's connected to. Look for e.g.:
  SCSI device sda: 4096 512-byte hdwr sectors (2 MB)
- Run the hackfw.sh program to patch the firmware. It'll backup your firmware
  and do a check on it to see it's patchable. If that's the case and you agree,
  it'll patch it and upload the new firmware.
- Use phack -l [image.png] to show a pic, e.g. one that's generated by
  a nice program to show statistics.

 
A patched unit still has the same capabilities as an unpatched one. The only
difference is that, in upgrade mode, you can send pictures to the LCD via
the USB-port, which enables stuff like the displaying of real-time server 
statistics.

This patch will work on devices with the ST2205U-chip (which is detected by the
hackfw.sh-program) and have a PCF8833-compatible display. If your device has
a 1.4" or 1.5" color CSTN-screen with a resolution of 128x128 pixels, it'll 
probably work.
